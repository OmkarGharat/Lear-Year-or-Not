# Lear-Year-or-Not

Write a program to Check whether given year is a leap year or not 

** A year containing an extra day. It has 366 days instead of the normal 365 days.

** The extra day is added in February, which has 29 days instead of the normal 28 days.

** Leap years occur every 4 years. 2020 is a leap year and so is 2024.

** Except that every 100 years special rules apply. For example 1900 was not a leap year, but 2000 was.
